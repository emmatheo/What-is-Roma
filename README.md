In this series, you’ll learn step by step how to install, configure, and build your first AI agents using **ROMA**.

## 🌍 What is ROMA?

ROMA (**Robust Open-source Multi-Agent framework**) is a toolkit that helps you **create, run, and manage AI agents**.  
Think of it like this:  

- A **single AI model** is like one worker.  
- **ROMA** lets you create **a whole team of workers (agents)** that talk to each other and solve tasks together.  

With ROMA, you can:  
- Build **autonomous agents** that use LLMs (like OpenAI’s GPT models).  
- Connect those agents to **tools** (APIs, web search, databases).  
- Run agents inside **workflows**, where they collaborate or specialize in tasks.

## 🧠 Why ROMA is Useful

- **Multi-agent collaboration** → agents can debate, fact-check, or split tasks.  
- **Open-source & extensible** → you can modify it for your own projects.  
- **Community-driven** → people are sharing agent examples, tutorials, and configs.

## 🔍 Example Use Cases

Here are a few things you could build with ROMA:  

- 📰 **News Summarizer Agent** → fetches the latest crypto news, then summarizes.  
- 💸 **Crypto Price Tracker Agent** → gets real-time BTC/ETH prices.  
- 📚 **Research Assistant Agents** → one finds sources, another summarizes them.  
- 🎮 **Game NPC Agents** → AI characters that interact in a game world.
